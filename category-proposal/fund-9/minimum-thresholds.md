# Minimum Thresholds

The following assumes an ADA price of $0.50 per ADA. This will likely change in the future. In that event there may be more or less contributors who can be paid to support the ecosystem.

The budget allocation is 975,000 ADA which means funding capacity to support between 19 to 8  contributors based on the lower $25,000 (50,000 ADA) and upper $60,000 (120,000 ADA) [budget range guidelines](budget-ranges-fund-9.md). &#x20;

Due to the higher number of developers we would estimate an average of $45,000 (90,000 ADA) per contributor which would mean around 9 contributors would get funded.

After the thresholds are met based on the voting results the highest voted candidates would then be selected until the funding is allocated.

### Minimum thresholds (number of people)

****

**Development**: 5

**Analysis:** 1

**Coordination:** 3

**Total**: 9



If the ADA price becomes $1 instead of approximately $0.50 then these thresholds can multiplied by two if they aren't updated before starting the contributor proposal submission process.



### Quantity needed

**Development**: High - The ecosystem has an increasing amount of complex core functionality required which warrants the need for a large number of developers.

**Coordination**: Low - Only a small people are needed to help bring together different ecosystem efforts to create meetings and events to share learnings across different tools and resources.

**Analysis**: Low to Moderate - A low to moderate amount of regular analysis is needed on the ecosystem and proposals to give a good overview of issues and solutions available in the ecosystem. Analysis is not needed at all times in every part of the ecosystem.
