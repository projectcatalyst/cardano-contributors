# Minimum Thresholds

The budget allocation is $900,000 which means funding capacity to support between 16 to 36 contributors based on the lower ($25,000) and upper ($55,000) [budget range guidelines](budget-ranges.md). &#x20;

Due to the higher number of developers we would estimate an average of $45,000 per contributor which would mean around 20 contributors would get funded.

After the thresholds are met based on the voting results the highest voted candidates would then be selected until the funding is allocated.

### Quantity needed

**Development**: High - The ecosystem has an increasing amount of complex core functionality required which warrants the need for a large number of developers.

**Coordination**: High - A large number of ecosystem projects and proposals are introduced each funding round that require coordination and support. Online meetings are an important way for the community to connect.

**Analysis**: Low - Some analysis is needed on the ecosystem and proposals to give a good overview of issues and solutions available in the ecosystem. Analysis is not needed at all times in every part of the ecosystem.
