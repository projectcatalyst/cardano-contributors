# Overview

Cardano contributors are a group of community members working full time to help support, improve and maintain the Cardano ecosystem. Contributors choose a role they want to support and then if elected get funded directly from the treasury to support the ecosystem.&#x20;

Contributors help in a multitude of areas including working on infrastructure and tooling, supporting the community, improving processes or even supporting other projects in the ecosystem.
