  Roles are groupings of a particular type of work that a community member will
  choose from when deciding where to focus their time whilst being a contributor

# Roles

Roles provide clarity to contributors and the wider community on what each contributor is mainly working on to support the ecosystem. Voters get clarity by being able to judge who they want to fill certain roles within the ecosystem.

Contributors select a role to indicate where they will spend the most time supporting the ecosystem. Selecting a role does not mean the contributor can't help in the other areas. It instead simply means they will look to spend the majority of their time in that selected role.

For each given funding round [budget ranges](budget-ranges.md) and [minimum thresholds](minimum-thresholds.md) are added to guide contributors making a good proposal and to ensure there's enough of each skill set in each contributor cohort.



## Roles available

The following are the initial roles for contributors to select from.

****

### Stake Pool Development

**Objective** - Helping to develop the scripts, libraries and tools that will help make it easier to run and operate a Cardano stake pool.

**Tasks**

* Interact with community stake pool operators to determine what problems exist
* Develop and maintain scripts, tools and libraries that help running a stake pool
* Support the improvement and promotion of security best practices
* Maintain and improve technical documentation and community resources
* Host technical discussion meetings about stake pool nodes to provide education and updates on ecosystem changes
* Provide technical support to stake pool operators

****

### Stake Pool Coordination

**Objective** - Bring together the stake pool community to identify problems and areas where more resources and support is needed.

**Tasks**

* Aggregate documentation and resources that make it easy for new stake pool operators
* Aggregate resources for layer two nodes and opportunities that existing stake pool operators can consider
* Host meetings with stake pool operators to discuss problems and reach consensus on future development plans steps forward



### Cardano Development

**Objective** - Support the development and alignment of open source projects across the Cardano ecosystem that developers can use to build on top of Cardano.

**Tasks**

* Create and maintain libraries, frameworks and utility code that help developers more easily build on Cardano
* Support existing open source projects with technical expertise and guidance
* Collaborate with teams to bring alignment in the ecosystem and prevent duplicated efforts where possible
* Host technical discussion meetings on Cardano development and security best practices
* Provide technical feedback where necessary to technical proposals in the Catalyst process
* Help create, improve and promote good security standards and design patterns for projects to consider when developing on Cardano



### **Cardano Coordination**

**Objective** - Maximise the collaboration in the Cardano developer ecosystem to bring more alignment and make the ecosystem more accessible to a wider amount of developers.

**Tasks**

* Support and promote open source tools, libraries and SDKs that the ecosystem can use
* Help teams collaborate and reduce duplicated efforts on similar open source tools, libraries or SDKs
* Host events to bring together the community to provide support and conduct problem sensing
* Promote best practices and standards within the community
* Manage an ecosystem calendar for events and community meet ups that help community members more easily find support or meet others in the ecosystem&#x20;
* Support improvements of translations for open source project documentation
* Provide technical support and guidance where possible



### Analysis

**Objective** - Research and present information on the development and usage of the Cardano blockchain to both inform the wider community and to also guide future development efforts.

**Tasks**

* Analyse current development ecosystem and produce reports on progress made
* Collect and aggregate community feedback about developer ecosystem
* Write and maintain ecosystem documentation
* Host meetings on problems, research or findings from analysis
* Research and analyse on chain data to look at how the blockchain is being used
* Research and analyse stake pool node operational data to report on performance
* Create reports based off on chain data that helps push forward ideas for improvement
* Research and report on other ecosystem developments that can benefit the Cardano ecosystem



## Potential future roles

The following are other options to consider that could become roles in the future. Currently **** the Cardano blockchain is managed and improved by IOG. Over time this will get pushed more onto the community as the governance phase Voltaire is released and the ecosystem reaches more maturity. In that event there will be future roles to consider that will benefit the Cardano ecosystem.

****

**Product**

Gathering community feedback and putting together analysis on how the chain is used could be applied to improving the product development of different development areas for the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;



**Design**

Design assets and improved user experience could be useful for the libraries, tools and SDKs created for the Cardano ecosystem. Documentation could also benefit from improved visual or video based resources.



**Education**

Many of the existing roles can support the education of the core ecosystem. Those tasks include writing documentation relevant to what each contributor is working on and also hosting meetings with other contributors and the wider community. Coordination, design, product and marketing roles are well suited for helping create visual education aids to support education. If there is difficulty maintaining ecosystem educational resources a group of full time education contributors could be considered that would solely focus on educational materials, sessions and generally supporting the community.

****

**Human resources**

The role of dealing with who is and isn't a full time contributor will be dealt with by the community governance vote. Initially through general voters and then potentially in the future refined down to engaged community members to make it more scalable and simplify the process. If a contributor does not perform or produces conflict with others they are likely to not secure future funding so managing contributors from a human resources perspective could be fairly self governing. Depending on the issues faced from funding contributors directly in the future a more full time human resource contributor could be considered to resolve and manage these issues. Alternatively this role could end up being achieved under a form of auditing role that is fulfilled by community members at the end of contributor funding terms with the right incentive models in place.



**Finance**

Contributors would be funded directly from the treasury initially in six month terms. This helps makes the initial process need little oversight. However the core ecosystem will have other costs such as server costs or usage of SaaS tools to help the contributors work effectively. Managing these costs could be done through a governance process done by contributors using a shared funding pot. If the complexity of managing a shared funding pot increases over time it will make sense to explore the usage of a finance role so that these concerns become better managed.
