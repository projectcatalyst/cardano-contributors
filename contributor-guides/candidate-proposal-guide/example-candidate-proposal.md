# Example Candidate Proposal

### Role

**My main role** - Development. I have worked as a developer over my career across different teams and companies. Through that experience I have taken user defined problems through to end solutions and have regularly helped taking problems from data modelling through to final implementation.&#x20;

My developer background was was a backend developer (Github provided below). I intend to spend most of my time supporting in this area and helping to create tools and libraries across multiple languages that help with the ease of development in the Cardano ecosystem.

As part of my role I would expect to be communicating with the developer ecosystem and DApp developers regularly to determine what areas in the ecosystem need improvement.

**Roles I may also support**

I intend to only focus on development as I both enjoy my time in this area the most and also the ecosystem is in need of a wider range of libraries and tools to build their DApps.

### **Contributions**

**Development** - I helped with the development of the [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io) API and helped make the Java and Scala SDK. The Blockfrost API helps other teams have easy access to onchain data for their own applications.

**Coordination** - I have hosted a number of meetings with project teams to discuss use cases for on-chain data and that helped to improve and guide future developments of tooling that makes it easier for applications to consume. You can find some of our recorded discussions on our YouTube - \[LINK HERE]
