# Responsibilities

A cohort of Cardano contributors should be able to cover the following areas of responsibility to support the growth and evolution of the Cardano ecosystem.



### **Support**&#x20;

Provide support for open source projects and community members learning about developing on Cardano. Contributors should be able to answer questions, help newcomers, provide technical support and make suggestions to those that need help. Contributors should help with translation support where possible and help with the ease of participation for a global audience.



### **Coordinate**

Bring the community together to discuss and collaborate over issues, ideas, topics and successes within the developer and stake pool ecosystems. Help bring efforts together to bring more alignment and collaboration where possible instead of duplicated efforts. Contributors should look to support and showcase the different efforts in the ecosystem that benefit developers, stake pool operators or other community members.

****

### **Govern**&#x20;

Support the development ecosystem where help is needed by reaching consensus on where to rapidly deploy funding that will bring the most impact to the ecosystem. Contributors should help to distribute funds to those who are pushing the ecosystem forward by solving problems in the development or stake pool operation ecosystems. Contributors are responsible for supporting governance decisions relevant to Cardano by helping to research and analyse information that is relevant to that decision for the voters to take into account.



### **Build**

Bring together data, analysis and feedback to guide and result in the development of better tools, libraries and SDKs for use by the wider community. Contributors are responsible for engaging with the community to identify the biggest problems that require the most attention for new developments and improvements. All opinions and feedback from the community should be welcomed to prioritise the main issues faced by developers and stake pool operators in the ecosystem.



### **Maintain**&#x20;

Review ecosystem parameters and services to inform the community and suggest changes to the ecosystem. Keep documentation and resources up to date and widely available for the community to learn about the Cardano developer ecosystem and operation of stake pools. Monitor and moderate the tools and libraries used to ensure they remain high quality and easy to use.



### **Delegate**&#x20;

Cardano contributors are not expected to be responsible for every form of work that supports the Cardano ecosystem. Contributors should delegate tasks and efforts towards community members and also support existing projects that help to improve the Cardano ecosystem. Contributors should try to distribute treasury funding they have accrued to support these initiatives that help the Cardano ecosystem.
